# Introduction

The package `"binomial"` provides functions to help help calculate and model various parts of a binomial distribution.

## Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is from from the parameters of $n$ trials with probability $p$ of success.

\ 

# Main functions in `"binomial"`
+ `bin_choose()` for the number of combinations of successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_probability()` for probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_distribution()` for binomial probability distribution
+ `bin_cumulative()` for cumulative probabilities of binomial distribution
+ `bin_variable()` for description of input parameters
