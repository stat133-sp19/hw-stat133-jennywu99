# Summary measures
+ `bin_mean()` computes expected value or mean of a binomial distribution
+ `bin_variance()` computes variance of a binomial distribution
+ `bin_mode()` computes most likely number of successes
+ `bin_skewness()` measures degree of asymmetry of probability distribution around mean
+ `bin_kurtosis()` measures tailedness of probability distribution

## `bin_mean()`
This function calculates the expected value or mean of a binomial distribution with $n$ trials and probability of success $p$.

For example:
10 trials and probability 0.3
```{r mean}
bin_mean(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

## `bin_variance()`
This function calclulates the variance of a binomial distribution with $n$ trials and probability of success $p$.

For example:
10 trials and probability 0.3
```{r var}
bin_variance(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

## `bin_mode()`
This function gives the most likely number of success in $n$ independent trials with probability of success $p$.

For example:
10 trials and probability 0.3
```{r mode}
bin_mode(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

## `bin_skewness()`
This function gives the skewness of a binomial distribution. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable around its mean.

Example:
skewness of a binomial distribution of 10 trials with probability 0.3
```{r skew}
bin_skewness(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```

## `bin_kurtosis()`
This function gives the kurtosis of a binomial distribution. Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a random variable. Similar to skewness, it is also a descriptor of the shape of a probability distribution.

Example:
kurtosis of a binomial distribution of 10 trials with probability 0.3
```{r kurt}
bin_kurtosis(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```
