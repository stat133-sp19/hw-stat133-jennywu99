# Workout03: binomial package
a package containing functions to calculate the binomial distribution and various summary measures (mean, variance, skew, etc.) based on number of successes, number of trials, and probability

## main functions
+ `bin_choose()` for the number of combinations of successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_probability()` for probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_distribution()` for binomial probability distribution
+ `bin_cumulative()` for cumulative probabilities of binomial distribution
+ `bin_variable()` for description of input parameters

## summary functions
+ `bin_mean()`
+ `bin_variance()`
+ `bin_mode()`
+ `bin_skewness()`
+ `bin_kurtosis()`
