# Introduction
---
The package `"binomial"` provides functions to help help calculate and model various parts of a binomial distribution.

## Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is from from the parameters of $n$ trials with probability $p$ of success.

\ 

# Main functions in `"binomial"`
+ `bin_choose()` for the number of combinations of $k$ successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_probability()` for probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_distribution()` for binomial probability distribution
+ `bin_cumulative()` for cumulative probabilities of binomial distribution
+ `bin_variable()` for description of input parameters

## `bin_choose()`
This function will give you the number of possible combinations of successes given the inputs of $n$ trials and $k$ successes.

For example:
The number of combinations of 2 successes in 5 trials =
```{r choose}
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
```

## `bin_probability()`
This function gives you the probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials with probability $p$ of success.

For example:
The probability of 2 successes in 5 trials with probability 0.5 =
```{r prob}
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## `bin_distribution()`
This function gives you the probability distribution of success in $n$ trials with probability $p$ as a data frame.

For example:
The binomial distribution of 5 trials with probability 0.5 is
```{r dis}
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## `bin_cumulative()`
This function gives you the cumulative distribution of success in $n$ trials with probability $p$ as a data frame in addition to the normal binomial distribution as given in `bin_distribution()`.

For example:
The cumulative and normal binomial distributions of 5 trials with probability 0.5 is
```{r cumulative}
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

## `bin_variable()`
This function is simply an easy way to nicely print the parameters of the inputs (number of trials and probability of success).

For example:
5 trials with a probability 0.5
```{r var}
bin_variable(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```
