# Euclidean Distance
## Definition
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{\textbf{pq}}$).

In Cartesian corrdinates, if **p** = (*p~1~*, *p~2~*, ..., *p~n~*) and **q** = (*q~1~*, *q~2~*, ..., *q~n~*) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\textbf{p}, \textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q}, \textbf{p}) = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2}$$
$$ = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i - p_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$||\textbf{p}|| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \cdot \textbf{p}}$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
