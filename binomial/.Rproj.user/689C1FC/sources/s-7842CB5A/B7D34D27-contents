# Workout03: binomial package
a package containing functions to calculate the binomial distribution and various summary measures (mean, variance, skew, etc.) based on number of successes, number of trials, and probability

## main functions
+ `bin_choose()` for the number of combinations of successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_probability()` for probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials
+ `bin_distribution()` for binomial probability distribution
+ `bin_cumulative()` for cumulative probabilities of binomial distribution
+ `bin_variable()` for description of input parameters

## summary functions
+ `bin_mean()` computes expected value or mean of a binomial distribution
+ `bin_variance()` computes variance of a binomial distribution
+ `bin_mode()` computes most likely number of successes
+ `bin_skewness()` measures degree of asymmetry of probability distribution around mean
+ `bin_kurtosis()` measures tailedness of probability distribution
